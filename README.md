Final exam 
What went well :
I think everything went well. I really saw how much I've grown from the beginning of the program till now. I didn't have much difficulties getting the activity requirements done. I've been practicing alot of recViews, CardViews, and so on. 

What didn't go well :
I completely forgot how to use sharedPrefs. That took me a while to research and I definetly have to go back and work on it some more. 
also, going back and converting my strings into res. was something new.
